# STA-141B-Final-Project

Group Members: Daniel Woo, Henman Tan, Junxi Chen, Shanshan Chen, Sarah Shaik

### Introduction

In this project we are going to look at the trends in the housing market during COVID years 2020-present and analyze how COVID has affected the housing market all over the U.S. We analyze trends for big and small cities and also compare home purchase to rental choice. This report uses 5 of the 7 categories that are related to the lessons in Fall 2021 STA-141B taught by Professor Andrew Farris. Categories that will be included are: 1. "Project organization, writeup readability, and overall conclusions", 2. "Code quality, readability, and efficiency", 4. "Data munging", 5. "Data visualization", 6. "Data extraction". Categories that will be excluded are: 3. "Scientific programming, custom algorithms, and numpy use" and 7. "Data Storage".


### Data 

The data we used in this project is from Zillow (https://www.zillow.com/research/data/). From Zillow, we will be using their data on home values such as Zillow Home Value Index (ZHVI), which contains a measure of typical home values and inventory information across many cities in the United States.

We were interested in this data for our topic because the Federal Reserve stated that as the pandemic continued, there were less supply of housing and an increase of demand for housing, which ultimately drove house prices higher. Another factor to contrast with the previous statement is that with COVID-19, housing situations vary for everyone and people no longer have commute to work, so they wouldn't feel the need to buy houses within the city of their workplace, indicating less demand for a house. We want to take a deeper look into this topic with our project.

This project reports on the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the housing market in the United States. To be more specific, we want to notice the changes (if there are any) of different states housing markets from before and after COVID-19. Another issue we will be looking over in this project is whether it is better to buy a property or to rent the property, and whether this has changed over time through the COVID-19 pandemic.

### Usage

The research and data from Zillow was scraped and converted from a CSV format into a Pandas dataframe in order to explore the data with analysis based on the material learned from class. For example, we will perform data munging on this dataframe with Pandas. 

This project will include data exploration, such as data visualizations, data extractions, filtering data and dropping missing data, and performing analysis on our output from the code.


### Documentation 

The other file in the zipped folder is a notebook folder containing a Jupyter notebook file called STA141B-Final-Project.ipynb, which is the directory with all our code and writeups. 

The notebook can be found here: https://github.com/daniel3521/STA-141B-Final-Project/blob/main/notebook/STA141B-Final-Project.ipynb


### Conclusion

Our analysis shows that the COVID pandemic has been drastically changing our housing market which we haven't seen since the 2008 recession. Urban centers and suburban metro areas have been affected differently but both show an increase in home values after the pandemic. This increase in turn has made it better to rent instead of buy across different metro areas in our data. To summarize, we've webscraped data from Zillow, analyzed/visualized our data, and have seen the drastic changes in the housing market post-pandemic.
